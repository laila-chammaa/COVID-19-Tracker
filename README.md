Created a COVID-19 dashboard using React.js and Charts.js, with Material UI to help spread awareness by visualizing the data. The app is interactive and responsive because it fetches live data asynchronously from a REST API.

Got familiar with React Hooks, CSS modules, extracting data, and data flow.
